# Docs
This documentation is for educational purpose. It comes directly from the courses I saw and practiced in my computer science degree, so for the commands
there is a context that you should consider and not copy/paste without paying attention.
Have fun reading my documentation, don't hesitate to download the content and reupload it for your own GitHub/website.
Peace ✌️🫥
